## How to Choose an AI Automation Agency: The Complete Checklist

Hiring the wrong automation partner can cost you months and tens of thousands of dollars. The right partner can transform your business.

This guide helps you tell the difference.

### Why Work with an Agency vs. DIY?

**When to DIY:**
- Simple automations (Zapier, Make)
- Technical team in-house
- Plenty of time to learn
- Small budget

**When to hire an agency:**
- Complex, multi-system workflows
- Custom AI/ML requirements
- Time is more valuable than money
- Need reliability and support
- Strategic guidance needed

### The Evaluation Checklist

Use this checklist when evaluating automation agencies:

#### Technical Expertise

**✅ Multi-platform experience**
- Can they work with Zapier, Make, n8n, and custom solutions?
- Or are they locked into one platform?
- Best agencies are tool-agnostic

**✅ AI/ML capabilities**
- Do they understand modern AI (GPT, Claude, etc.)?
- Can they implement custom AI solutions?
- Or just basic automation?

**✅ Integration experience**
- Have they integrated with your specific tools?
- CRM, e-commerce, accounting systems
- Ask for examples

**✅ Custom development ability**
- Can they build when off-the-shelf doesn't work?
- API development experience
- Database and backend capabilities

#### Business Understanding

**✅ Industry experience**
- Have they worked in your industry?
- Do they understand your terminology?
- Can they reference relevant case studies?

**✅ Process thinking**
- Do they ask about your business processes?
- Or just jump to technical solutions?
- Good agencies optimize before automating

**✅ ROI focus**
- Do they talk about business impact?
- Or just features and capabilities?
- They should help you build a business case

#### Working Relationship

**✅ Communication style**
- Clear, jargon-free explanations
- Responsive to questions
- Proactive updates

**✅ Documentation**
- Do they document what they build?
- Can you maintain it after they leave?
- Training included?

**✅ Ongoing support**
- What happens after launch?
- Maintenance and updates?
- SLA for issues?

### Questions to Ask Every Agency

**About Their Experience:**

1. "How many automation projects have you completed?"
2. "What's your experience with [specific tool/platform]?"
3. "Can you share case studies from similar businesses?"
4. "What was your most complex implementation?"
5. "Who will actually be working on my project?"

**About Their Process:**

6. "How do you approach new projects?"
7. "What information do you need from us?"
8. "How long does a typical project take?"
9. "How do you handle scope changes?"
10. "What does testing and QA look like?"

**About Business Impact:**

11. "How do you measure success?"
12. "What ROI have similar clients seen?"
13. "How quickly can we expect to see results?"
14. "What risks should we be aware of?"

**About After Launch:**

15. "What happens after the project is complete?"
16. "How is ongoing maintenance handled?"
17. "What if something breaks?"
18. "Can we make changes ourselves?"
19. "What documentation will we receive?"

**About Pricing:**

20. "How is pricing structured?"
21. "Are there ongoing costs?"
22. "What's included vs. extra?"
23. "How do you handle overruns?"

### Red Flags to Watch For

**🚩 No discovery process**
If they give you a quote without understanding your business, run. They're guessing.

**🚩 One-size-fits-all solutions**
"We use [single platform] for everything." The best solution varies by need.

**🚩 Overpromising**
"We can automate everything." "100% guaranteed results." Experienced agencies are realistic.

**🚩 Unclear pricing**
Vague quotes, hidden fees, no written proposal. Get everything in writing.

**🚩 No questions asked**
Good agencies ask lots of questions. If they don't, they're not understanding your needs.

**🚩 Can't explain simply**
If they can't explain their approach in simple terms, they either don't understand it or are hiding something.

**🚩 No references**
Legitimate agencies have happy clients. Ask for references and actually call them.

**🚩 High-pressure sales**
"This offer expires tomorrow." Quality agencies don't need pressure tactics.

### Pricing Models Explained

**Fixed Price:**
- Set price for defined scope
- Best for: Clear, well-defined projects
- Risk: Scope creep battles

**Hourly/Time & Materials:**
- Pay for time spent
- Best for: Exploratory or evolving projects
- Risk: Budget uncertainty

**Monthly Retainer:**
- Ongoing relationship, set monthly fee
- Best for: Continuous optimization
- Risk: Paying when little work needed

**Value-Based:**
- Price tied to results delivered
- Best for: High-confidence, measurable outcomes
- Risk: Misaligned incentives

**Hybrid:**
- Fixed price for build, retainer for support
- Often the best of both worlds

### Typical Pricing Ranges

| Project Type | Low End | Mid Range | High End |
|--------------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Simple zapier workflows | $500 | $2,000 | $5,000 |
| Multi-platform automation | $5,000 | $15,000 | $30,000 |
| AI-powered solutions | $10,000 | $30,000 | $100,000+ |
| Enterprise transformation | $50,000 | $150,000 | $500,000+ |

Monthly support typically runs 10-20% of project cost.

### The Selection Process
