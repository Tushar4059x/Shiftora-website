### When to Use Each

**Use Zapier when:**

- You need an obscure integration
- Team is non-technical
- Budget isn't constrained

**Use Make when:**

Many businesses use multiple tools:

- **n8n** for custom, self-hosted workflows

There's no rule saying you must pick just one.

### ScaletrailAI's Recommendation

**For most SMBs:** Start with **Make**. It hits the sweet spot of power, price, and usability. You can always add Zapier for specific integrations or n8n for custom needs.

**For enterprises:** Consider **n8n Cloud** or self-hosted for control, with **Zapier** for quick departmental needs.

**For developers:** **n8n** self-hosted is the clear winner for flexibility and cost.
