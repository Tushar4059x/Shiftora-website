## RPA vs AI Automation: Understanding the Differences

"RPA" and "AI" are often used interchangeably. They shouldn't be—they're different technologies that solve different problems.

Understanding the difference helps you choose the right solution.

### RPA: The Digital Worker

**Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** uses software bots to mimic human actions in computer systems.

**How it works:**
- Records human actions (clicks, keystrokes)
- Replays them exactly
- Follows rigid, rule-based logic
- Works with existing systems (no APIs needed)

**Best for:**
- Repetitive, high-volume tasks
- Rule-based processes
- Legacy systems without APIs
- Copy-paste between systems

**Examples:**
- Logging into systems
- Copying data between applications
- Filling out forms
- Generating reports from templates

### AI Automation: The Intelligent Worker

**AI Automation** uses machine learning and natural language processing to understand, decide, and adapt.

**How it works:**
- Understands unstructured data (text, images)
- Makes decisions based on patterns
- Learns and improves over time
- Handles exceptions and variations

**Best for:**
- Understanding documents and text
- Making decisions with nuance
- Handling exceptions
- Improving over time

**Examples:**
- Reading and extracting invoice data
- Understanding customer emails
- Classifying support tickets
- Recommending actions

### Key Differences

| Aspect | RPA | AI Automation |
|--------|-----|---------------|
| Logic | Rules-based | Learning-based |
| Data handling | Structured only | Structured + unstructured |
| Adaptability | Fixed | Improves over time |
| Exceptions | Fails or escalates | Can handle many |
| Setup | Record & playback | Training required |
| Cost | Lower upfront | Higher upfront |
| Scalability | Linear | Exponential |

### When to Use RPA

✅ Tasks are 100% rule-based
✅ Process never changes
✅ No judgment required
✅ Legacy systems involved
✅ Quick wins needed
✅ Budget is limited

**Ideal use cases:**
- Data migration
- Report generation
- System data entry
- Form filling
- Scheduled tasks

### When to Use AI

✅ Data is unstructured
✅ Decisions require judgment
✅ Exceptions are common
✅ Processes evolve
✅ Scale matters
✅ Long-term investment OK

**Ideal use cases:**
- Document processing
- Customer interaction
- Content categorization
- Predictive actions
- Anomaly detection

### The Power Combination: RPA + AI

The most powerful solutions combine both:

**Intelligent Document Processing:**
- AI reads and understands documents
- RPA enters data into systems

**Smart Customer Service:**
- AI understands and responds
- RPA performs actions in systems

**Adaptive Workflows:**
- AI decides what to do
- RPA executes the actions

### Cost Comparison

**RPA:**
- Implementation: $5k-50k per bot
- Maintenance: 15-25% annually
- Scales linearly with volume

**AI Automation:**
- Implementation: $10k-100k+
- Maintenance: 10-20% annually
- Scales more efficiently

### Making the Right Choice

**Start with RPA if:**
- You need quick ROI
- Processes are stable
- Systems are legacy
- Budget is tight

**Start with AI if:**
- Data is unstructured
- Scale is critical
- Long-term investment OK
- Competitive advantage needed

**Use both when:**
- Processes are complex
- Maximum efficiency needed
- Long-term automation roadmap
