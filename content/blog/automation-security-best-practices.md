## Automation Security: Keeping Your Automated Systems Safe

Every automation is a potential attack vector. Each connection point, each data transfer, each credential stored.

But security shouldn't stop automation. It should shape it.

### The Automation Security Landscape

**New Risks with Automation:**
- API keys and credentials stored
- Data flowing between systems
- Third-party platform access
- Expanded attack surface
- Automated actions at scale

**The Stakes:**
- Data breaches
- Financial loss
- Compliance violations
- Reputation damage
- System compromise

### Core Security Principles

**1. Least Privilege**
Give automations only the permissions they need. Nothing more.
- Scoped API keys
- Limited account access
- Role-based permissions

**2. Defense in Depth**
Multiple layers of security:
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Encryption
- Monitoring
- Backup

**3. Zero Trust**
Never assume trust. Verify everything:
- Every connection authenticated
- Every action logged
- Every access checked

### Securing Common Automations

**API Connections:**
- Use OAuth when available
- Rotate keys regularly
- Store in secure vaults
- Never in plain text/code

**Data Transfers:**
- Encrypt in transit (TLS/SSL)
- Encrypt at rest
- Minimize data copied
- Delete when done

**Credentials:**
- Use password managers
- Never hardcode
- Environment variables
- Secrets management

**Third-Party Platforms:**
- Review security practices
- Understand data handling
- Check compliance
- Monitor for breaches

### Security Checklist

**For Every Automation:**
- [ ] Minimum required permissions
- [ ] Credentials stored securely
- [ ] Data encrypted in transit
- [ ] Audit logging enabled
- [ ] Error handling doesn't expose data
- [ ] Regular access review

**Quarterly:**
- [ ] Rotate API keys
- [ ] Review active automations
- [ ] Check vendor security updates
- [ ] Test backup/recovery

### Compliance Considerations

**GDPR:**
- Know what data flows where
- Consent for automated processing
- Right to deletion implemented

**SOC 2:**
- Access controls documented
- Monitoring in place
- Incident response plan

**HIPAA:**
- BAAs with all vendors
- PHI handling documented
- Encryption requirements met
