## Automation Strategy: Building a Roadmap for Success

Most businesses automate randomly—whatever seems urgent or easy. This leads to tool sprawl, disconnected workflows, and unrealized potential.

A strategic approach delivers 10x the results.

### The Strategic Automation Framework

**Step 1: Assess Current State**
- Map all business processes
- Identify manual touchpoints
- Measure time and cost
- Document pain points

**Step 2: Define Goals**
- Cost reduction targets
- Time savings goals
- Quality improvements
- Growth enablement

**Step 3: Prioritize Opportunities**
Score each opportunity:
- Impact (1-10)
- Effort (1-10)
- Risk (1-10)
- Priority = Impact / (Effort × Risk)

**Step 4: Build the Roadmap**
- Quick wins (Month 1-2)
- Foundation (Month 3-4)
- Expansion (Month 5-6)
- Optimization (Ongoing)

**Step 5: Execute**
- Agile implementation
- Regular review
- Continuous adjustment

### The Automation Prioritization Matrix

| | Low Effort | High Effort |
|---|------------|-------------|
| **High Impact** | Do First | Plan Carefully |
| **Low Impact** | Maybe Later | Don't Bother |

### Building Your Roadmap

**Phase 1: Quick Wins**

**Phase 2: Foundation**
