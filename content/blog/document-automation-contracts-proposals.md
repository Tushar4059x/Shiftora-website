## Document Automation: Generate Contracts, Proposals & More in Seconds

How much time do you spend creating documents from templates? Proposals, contracts, agreements, reports—changing names, dates, and details each time.

It's tedious, error-prone, and completely automatable.

### The Document Automation Opportunity

**Common documents to automate:**
- Proposals and quotes
- Contracts and agreements
- Invoices and statements
- Reports and summaries
- Offer letters
- NDAs
- Onboarding packets
- Certificates

**Time savings:**
| Document Type | Manual Time | Automated Time |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| Sales proposal | 2-4 hours | 5 minutes |
| Contract | 30-60 min | 2 minutes |
| Report | 1-3 hours | 0 (automatic) |
| Offer letter | 20 min | 1 minute |

### How Document Automation Works

**Step 1: Create Template**
- Build document with variables
- Mark merge fields: {{customer_name}}, {{contract_value}}
- Include conditional sections
- Design for all scenarios

**Step 2: Connect Data Source**
- CRM for customer info
- Deals for pricing
- Products for details
- Custom inputs

**Step 3: Trigger Generation**
- Manual trigger (button click)
- Automatic (deal stage change)
- Scheduled (monthly reports)
- API (from other systems)

**Step 4: Review and Send**
- Document generated instantly
- Review if needed
- Send for signature
- Track status

### Building Automated Proposals

**Data pulled automatically:**
- Company name and contact
- Product/service selected
- Pricing from CRM
- Terms from profile
- Rep info
- Valid dates

**Dynamic sections:**
- Different service descriptions
- Industry-specific case studies
- Custom terms by deal size
- Optional add-ons included

**Output options:**
- PDF for email
- Web link for tracking
- Google Doc for collaboration
- Word for editing

**Tools:** PandaDoc, Proposify, Qwilr, Better Proposals

### Automating Contracts

**What gets automated:**
- Party information
- Effective dates
- Service terms
- Pricing and payment
- Special conditions
- Signature blocks

**Conditional logic:**
- If contract value > X → include clause Y
- If product = A → use terms version 1
- If annual → add discount terms

**Workflow:**
1. Deal reaches "Contract" stage
2. Contract auto-generated
3. Sent for signature
4. Signed → Deal updated → Invoice triggered

**Tools:** DocuSign, PandaDoc, Ironclad, ContractPodAi

### Report Automation

**Reports that generate themselves:**
- Daily/weekly/monthly summaries
- Pipeline reports
- Performance reports
- Financial statements
- Client reports

**Data sources:**
- CRM
- Accounting software
- Marketing platforms
- Custom databases
- Spreadsheets

**Delivery:**
- Emailed on schedule
- Uploaded to shared drive
- Posted to Slack
- Attached to records

**Tools:** Looker Studio, Power BI, custom templates
