## CRM Automation: How to 10x Your Sales Productivity

Sales reps spend only 36% of their time actually selling. The rest? Data entry, admin, and CRM updates.

That's backwards. Here's how to flip it.

### The CRM Time Drain

Where sales time goes wrong:

| Activity | Time Spent | Should Be |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Data entry | 17% | 0% |
| CRM updates | 12% | 2% |
| Scheduling meetings | 8% | 0% |
| Lead research | 10% | 5% |
| Admin/reporting | 15% | 3% |
| **Actual selling** | **36%** | **90%** |

CRM automation fixes this.

### What to Automate in Your CRM

**Lead Entry**
- Web forms → CRM (instant)
- Email inquiries → CRM (parsed)
- Social leads → CRM (captured)
- Manually entered leads → Never again

**Data Enrichment**
- Company info (auto-pulled)
- Contact details (auto-found)
- Social profiles (auto-linked)
- Tech stack (auto-detected)

**Activity Logging**
- Emails sent (auto-logged)
- Calls made (auto-recorded)
- Meetings held (auto-logged)
- Notes created (auto-transcribed)

**Pipeline Management**
- Stage changes (triggered by actions)
- Deal updates (calculated automatically)
- Next steps (auto-assigned)
- Reminders (auto-scheduled)

**Reporting**
- Daily/weekly reports (auto-generated)
- Pipeline updates (real-time)
- Forecasting (calculated)
- Leaderboards (live)

### CRM Automation Playbook

**Automation 1: Lead Capture → CRM**

When leads come in, they go straight to CRM:
- Form submission → New contact
- Email parser → Extract details → New contact
- LinkedIn message → New contact + source
- Chatbot conversation → New contact + transcript

**Automation 2: Lead Enrichment**

New contact triggers enrichment:
- Pull company data (Clearbit, ZoomInfo)
- Find email and phone (Hunter, Apollo)
- Add LinkedIn profile
- Score based on fit

**Automation 3: Lead Routing**

Leads assigned automatically:
- By territory → Regional rep
- By company size → SMB or Enterprise
- By source → Inbound or Outbound
- By product interest → Specialist
- Round-robin → Fair distribution

**Automation 4: Activity Logging**

Everything tracked without typing:
- Email sync → All emails logged
- Call integration → Calls logged + recorded
- Calendar sync → Meetings logged
- AI notes → Conversation summarized

**Automation 5: Pipeline Automation**

Deals move themselves:
- Demo scheduled → Move to Demo stage
- Proposal sent → Move to Proposal stage
- Contract viewed → Alert + move stage
- No activity 7 days → Alert + task

**Automation 6: Follow-Up Sequences**

Never forget to follow up:
- Demo complete → Send recap
- Proposal sent → Follow up Day 3
- Gone quiet → Re-engagement sequence
- Lost deal → Win-back sequence

**Automation 7: Reporting**

Reports write themselves:
- Daily activity email
- Weekly pipeline summary
- Monthly performance report
- Real-time dashboards

Start simple. Add complexity as needed.

Automation assists, humans decide.

**Mistake 4: Ignoring adoption**
The best automation is useless if reps bypass it.

Review and optimize monthly.
