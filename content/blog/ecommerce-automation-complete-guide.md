## Ecommerce Automation: Scale Your Store Without Scaling Your Team

Ecommerce should be scalable. That's the point.

But many store owners find themselves drowning in operations as they grow. More orders = more work = more staff = lower margins.

Automation breaks this cycle.

| Inventory management | 5-10 | 90% |
| Marketing | 10-20 | 70% |
| Returns/exchanges | 5-10 | 75% |
| Reporting | 3-5 | 95% |
| **Total** | **43-80** | **Most of it** |
