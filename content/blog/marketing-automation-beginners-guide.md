## Marketing Automation for Beginners: Complete Getting Started Guide

Marketing automation sounds complex. It isn't.

At its core, it's about sending the right message to the right person at the right time—automatically.

### What is Marketing Automation?

Marketing automation uses software to:

**3. Abandoned Cart Recovery**
Trigger: Cart abandoned  
Action: Remind them to complete purchase

**4. Re-engagement Campaigns**
Trigger: No activity for 30 days  
Action: Win back with special offer

Trigger: Customer buys  
Action: Thank you, how-to, upsell
