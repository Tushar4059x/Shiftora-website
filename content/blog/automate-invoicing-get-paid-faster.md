## Automate Invoicing: Get Paid Faster, Work Less

Late payments are the #1 cash flow killer for small businesses. And manual invoicing makes it worse—invoices go out late, follow-ups are forgotten, and money sits uncollected.

Automation fixes all of this.

### The Manual Invoicing Problem

**Time cost:**
- Creating invoices: 10-15 min each
- Sending invoices: 5 min each
- Following up: 10-20 min per late invoice
- Reconciling payments: 15-30 min daily
- **Total:** 10-20 hours/month for a small business

**Revenue cost:**
- Delayed invoicing = delayed payment
- Missed follow-ups = unpaid invoices
- Errors = disputes and delays
- **Bad debt average:** 1.5% of revenue

### The Automated Invoicing Flow

**Trigger → Generate → Send → Track → Follow Up → Reconcile**

All automatic. Let's build each step.

### Step 1: Automatic Invoice Generation

**Trigger-based invoicing:**
- Project completed → Invoice generated
- Subscription renews → Invoice sent
- Milestone reached → Partial invoice
- Time logged → Time-based invoice

**Data auto-populated:**
- Customer details from CRM
- Project/product from source system
- Pricing from rate cards
- Payment terms from customer profile

**Tools:**
- QuickBooks, Xero, FreshBooks (native triggers)
- Stripe (subscription invoicing)
- Zapier/Make (custom triggers)
- Custom solutions (complex logic)

### Step 2: Automatic Invoice Sending

**When to send:**
- Immediately upon generation
- On specific dates (1st of month)
- After approval workflow (if needed)
- Batched weekly/monthly

**How to send:**
- Email (most common)
- Customer portal
- EDI (enterprise)
- Multiple channels

**Include automatically:**
- Personalized message
- Payment links
- PDF attachment
- Due date reminder

### Step 3: Automatic Payment Tracking

**Monitor payment status:**
- Invoice viewed (email tracking)
- Invoice opened (portal tracking)
- Payment initiated
- Payment received

**Update systems automatically:**
- Mark invoice paid
- Update customer balance
- Log payment in accounting
- Trigger receipt email

### Step 4: Automatic Follow-Up

**Pre-due reminders:**
- 7 days before: Friendly reminder
- 3 days before: Due date reminder
- Day of: Final reminder

**Past-due sequences:**
- Day 1: Courtesy notice
- Day 7: First follow-up
- Day 14: Second follow-up
- Day 21: Escalation notice
- Day 30: Collections notice

**Escalation triggers:**
- Stop automated emails after X attempts
- Notify account manager
- Create collection task
- Flag account for review

### Step 5: Automatic Reconciliation

**Match payments to invoices:**
- Bank feed integration
- Payment processor sync
- AI matching for unclear payments
- Exception queue for manual review

**Update all systems:**
- Accounting software
- CRM (customer paid)
- Project management (close project)
- Reporting systems
