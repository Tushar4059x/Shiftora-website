## Automate Repetitive Tasks: A Practical Guide

If you do something more than twice, it deserves automation. Here's how to find and eliminate repetitive work.

### Finding Repetitive Tasks

**Track for one week:**
- What do you do daily?
- What interrupts deep work?
- What makes you say "ugh, again?"

**Common culprits:**
- Email responses
- Data entry
- Report creation
- Status updates
- Scheduling
- Follow-ups
- Reminders
- File management

### Automation Candidates

- ✅ Rule-based decisions
- ✅ Don't require creativity
- ✅ Use digital tools

**Not ideal for automation:**

- ❌ Always different
- ❌ Require judgment
- ❌ Need personal touch

### Quick-Win Automations
