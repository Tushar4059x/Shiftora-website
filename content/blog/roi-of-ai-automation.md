## The ROI of AI Automation: What to Expect

"What's the ROI?" It's the first question every business owner asks about automation—and rightfully so. Let's look at the real numbers.

### The Formula for Automation ROI

ROI = (Gains from Automation - Cost of Automation) / Cost of Automation × 100

**Gains include:**
- Time saved (converted to dollar value)
- Error reduction (avoided costs)
- Increased capacity (revenue enabled)
- Employee retention (avoided turnover costs)

**Costs include:**
- Implementation fees
- Monthly subscription/maintenance
- Training time

### Case Study #1: E-Commerce Order Processing

**Before:**
- 500+ orders/day processed manually
- 4 full-time employees on data entry
- 4.2% error rate causing returns/complaints
- 8 hours daily across team

**After (with AI automation):**
- Same 500+ orders processed automatically
- 0 employees on data entry (reassigned to customer success)
- 0.1% error rate
- 45 minutes daily (oversight only)

**ROI Calculation:**
- Labor savings: $160,000/year (4 employees)
- Error reduction: $45,000/year (fewer returns/refunds)
- Total annual benefit: $205,000
- Implementation cost: $15,000
- Annual subscription: $18,000
- **First-year ROI: 521%**

### Case Study #2: Real Estate Lead Follow-Up

**Before:**
- 200+ leads/month
- 24-hour average response time
- 12% lead-to-appointment conversion
- 40 hours/week on follow-up emails

**After (with AI automation):**
- Same lead volume
- 2-minute average response time
- 34% lead-to-appointment conversion
- 8 hours/week (warm leads only)

**ROI Calculation:**
- Additional appointments: 44/month
- Additional closings (20% close rate): 9/month
- Additional revenue: $81,000/month at $9k avg sale
- Implementation: $12,000
- Monthly cost: $1,500
- **First-month ROI: Paid back in 6 days**

### Case Study #3: Customer Support Automation

**Before:**
- 3,000 support tickets/month
- 6 support agents
- 24-hour average resolution
- $18 cost per ticket

**After (with AI chatbot):**
- Same ticket volume
- 80% resolved by AI instantly
- 2 support agents (complex issues)
- $4 average cost per ticket

**ROI Calculation:**
- Agent salary savings: $180,000/year (4 agents)
- Cost per ticket reduction: $168,000/year
- Total benefit: $348,000/year
- Implementation: $25,000
- Annual cost: $24,000
- **First-year ROI: 610%**

### Average ROI by Automation Type

| Automation Type | Typical ROI Range | Payback Period |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Data Entry | 300-600% | 2-4 months |
| Customer Support | 400-800% | 1-3 months |
| Email Automation | 200-400% | 1-2 months |
| Reporting | 150-300% | 3-6 months |
| Workflow Automation | 250-500% | 2-4 months |

### When You WON'T See Good ROI

To be honest, automation isn't always the answer:

- **Very low volume** - If you process 10 invoices/month, automation may not be worth it
- **Highly unique tasks** - If every task is completely different, AI struggles
- **No clear process** - Automation requires a defined workflow to replicate
