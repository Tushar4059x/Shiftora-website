## Automation for Startups: Scale Fast Without Breaking

Startups face a unique challenge: you need to move fast, but you can't hire fast enough to keep up.

Automation is the answer. But what should you automate first?

### The Startup Automation Priority Stack

**Phase 1: Survival (Pre-Revenue)**
Focus: Don't waste time on things that don't directly get customers.

- Lead capture forms → CRM
- Basic email sequences
- Meeting scheduling
- Simple invoicing

**Phase 2: Traction (Early Revenue)**
Focus: Handle increasing volume without proportional headcount.

- Customer onboarding
- Support ticket routing
- Basic reporting
- Payment processing

**Phase 3: Growth (Scaling)**
Focus: Systematize everything that works.

- Full marketing automation
- Sales pipeline automation
- Operations workflows
- Advanced analytics

### Essential Startup Automations

**1. Lead to Close**
- Capture → CRM → Nurture → Demo → Proposal → Close
- All automatic except the actual conversations

**2. Customer Onboarding**
- Signup → Welcome → Training → Check-ins → Success
- Scales to any number of customers

**3. Support**
- Query → Categorize → Route/Auto-respond → Resolution
- 80% handled without human

**4. Billing**
- Subscription → Invoice → Collect → Dunning → Reconcile
- Never chase payments manually

### Startup-Friendly Tools

**Budget Stack ($0-100/mo):**
| Function | Tool | Price |
|----------|------|-------|
| CRM | HubSpot Free | $0 |
| Email | Mailchimp/Brevo | $0 |
| Scheduling | Calendly | $0 |

### Startup Automation Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Over-automating too early**
Don't automate what you haven't validated manually.

**Mistake 2: Choosing enterprise tools**
You don't need Salesforce. Start simple.

**Mistake 3: Too many tools**
Integration hell is real. Fewer, well-connected tools.

**Mistake 4: Ignoring documentation**
Document before you forget why you built it.
